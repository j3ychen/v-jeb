# v-jeb

Forked from <a href="https://github.com/kevinmcvey">Kevin McVey</a>'s v-chill repo, which contains a Chrome extension that converts all text to lowercase and replaces "unchill words" with "chill counterparts" (e.g., `very` becomes `v`), v-jeb adds another feature to the extension: `jeb` and `jeb bush` are replaced by a much more exciting `JEB!`
