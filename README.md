# v-jeb

Forked from <a href="">Kevin McVey</a>'s v-chill repo, which contains a Chrome extension that converts all text to lowercase and replaces "unchill words" with "chill counterparts" (e.g., `very` becomes `v`), v-jeb adds another feature to the extension: `Jeb` and `Jeb Bush` are replaced by the more exciting `Jeb!`
